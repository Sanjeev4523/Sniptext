# Sniptext
The Idea is to create a screeshot tool which can convert the image into text. This is incredibly useful while watching online coding video which 
dont have a source code file.

Librarise used include
- NodeJS
- Electron FrameWork
- Windows Snipping tool
- Tesseract OCR

Usage
In the folder
> npm start


Note: Thought the software works with snipping tool. windows is currently switching to a new snipping tool. Electron app is incomplete for now
so that I can incorporate that when it comes into effect.
